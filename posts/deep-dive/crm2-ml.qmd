\newcommand{\EE}{\mathbb{E}}

In a [previous post](crm1-fun.qmd), we've modelled the loss of a portfolio of instruments by $L = \sum_{i=1}^d \mu_i S_i I_i$, incorporating the event of default $I_i$, exposure at default $\mu_i$ and loss given default $S_i$.


Our goal now is to estimate the underlying parameters of this model. For the Bernoulli random variable $I_i$, the only parameter is $p_i=\EE[I_i]$ and for $S_i$, we make an assumption that it is Beta distributed, so there are two parameters.

Assume that $S_i$ is Beta distributed with parameters $a,b$
