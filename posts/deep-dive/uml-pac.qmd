## Setting 

In a supervised learning, we specify 
-  the example space $\mathcal X$
-  the label space $\mathcal Y$
-  the sample $S = \{(x_i,y_i)\}$ where $x_i\in \mathcal X, y_i\in \mathcal Y$
-  an hypothese class $\mathcal H$, known as the inductive bias
-  a loss function $\ell: \mathcal H \times \mathcal X \times \mathcal Y \to \RR_+$

Making the assumption that the sample is iid, from the sample $S$,  we aim at finding a $h\in\mathcal H$ which minimises the true risk
$$
L_D(h) = \EE[\ell(h)]  
$$


The name of the game is from sample $S$ learn a hypothesis $h_S\in \mathcal H$ which minimises the risk
$L_D()$
